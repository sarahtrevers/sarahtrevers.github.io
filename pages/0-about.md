### {{ page.title }}
I have been a singer from an extremely early age and sang extensively in my early years in choirs both at school and outside of School. I studied with Jane McDouall in my teenage years and obtained my Grade 8 prior to starting University. Whilst studying Geography at the University of Birmingham I took advantage of the links with the Birmingham Conservatoir where I studied voice with Andrea Calledine. Whilst in Birmingham I sang with the Birmingham University Singers and toured to Poznan for the International Choir Festival and also to Prague. Whilst completing my Masters at Nottingham University I sang with Viva Voce and toured to Dublin. I recently studied with Jane McDouall and obtained my singing performance diploma with the ABRSM. I am a member of the East of England Singers and regularly perform solos with the choir.
