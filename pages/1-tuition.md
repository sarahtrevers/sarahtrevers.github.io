## Singing Tuition

#### Adult Lessons

There are many different reasons why adults might like singing lessons, for example:

<ul>
	<li>To fulfil a long-held desire;</li> 
	<li>To resume an old hobby;</li> 
	<li>To build on existing abilities;</li> 
	<li>To help with a specific technical issue such as breathing;</li> 
	<li>To learn a specific song or vocal line.</li> 
</ul>

Whatever the reason, singing lessons can give a real sense of satisfaction, improve ability and confidence and provide a skill that will stay with you for the rest of your life.

Sarah offers singing tuition in an informal, relaxed environment and the lessons can be tailored to your requirements. Lessons can be weekly, bi weekly, long term or short term; please <a href="{{ '/contact' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">contact Sarah</a> to discuss the options.

#### Children's Lessons
The aim of lessons for children is to create a fun learning environment, such that the love of singing can be fostered. Lessons will cover some elements of music theory so that all children begin to learn to read music or enhance their knowledge of music theory, and the songs learnt will cover a variety of genres including pop, classical, shows and more.  If your child would like to progress through an examination system then this is possible; however, if you feel examinations are not right for your child then lessons will be planned such that progress is made and achievement recognised in an informal manner.

	<p>An opportunity to learn to sing or enhance your skills!</p>
</header>
If you are on maternity/paternity leave or you are at home with children then this could be an ideal opportunity to start learning, to improve your skills or just to have a bit of ‘me’ time!  Sarah can teach you in the comfort of your own home whilst your child sleeps, plays in their own environment with you still able to have a watchful eye, or being held by you. The lesson will be relaxed and fun.  As a mother of three children who are all 5 and under, Sarah is very able to cope with working with some background noise so don’t let that stop you! <a href="{{ '/contact' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Contact Sarah</a> to discuss your situation and the options available.
