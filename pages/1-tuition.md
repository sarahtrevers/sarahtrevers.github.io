## Singing Tuition

#### Adult Lessons

There are many different reasons why adults might like singing lessons, for example:

<ul>
	<li>Have you always wished that you could sing?</li> 
	<li>You used to sing and you want to ‘get back into it’?</li> 
	<li>You would really like to improve your singing?</li> 
	<li>You need help with a specific issue for example breathing?</li> 
	<li>You need help to learn a specific song or vocal line?</li> 
</ul>

I offer teaching of singing in a fun, relaxed environment and the lessons can be tailored to your requirements. Lessons can be weekly, bi weekly, long term or short term; please contact me to discuss the options.

#### Children's Lessons
The aim of the lessons for children is to create a fun learning environment such that the love of singing can be built. Lessons will cover some elements of music theory so that all children begin to learn to read music or enhance their knowledge of music theory, and the songs learnt will cover a variety of genres including pop, classical, shows and more.  If your child would like to progress through an examination system then this is possible, however, if you feel examinations are not right for your child then lessons will be planned such that progress is made and achievement recognised without taking exams.

	<h4>Maternity and Paternity Leave</h4>
	<p>An opportunity to learn to sing or enhance your skills!</p>
</header>
If you are on maternity/paternity leave or you are at home with children then view this as an ideal opportunity to start learning, improve your skills or just an opportunity to have a bit of ‘me’ time and an enjoyable sing!  I can teach you in the comfort of your own home whilst your child sleeps, plays in their own environment with you still able to have a watchful eye, or being held by you! The lesson will be relaxed and fun.  As a mother of three children who are all 5 and under, I am very able to cope with working with some background noise so don’t let that stop you! Contact me to discuss your situation and thus the options available!
