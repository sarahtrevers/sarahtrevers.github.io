## Weddings
Sarah is an experienced wedding singer and has a wide repertoire, including but not limited to classical and folk, pop songs and songs from the shows, and is used to performing both accompanied and unaccompanied pieces. Sarah is always open to learning something new in order to accommodate specific requirements, so please donâ€™t hesitate to request a specific piece. 
 
During both Church and Civil ceremonies, there are a number of points at which it can be appropriate to have a soloist or a musical accompaniment. These include the entrance of the bride, the signing of the register and the exit of the happy couple. If required, Sarah can help you plan all the music for the wedding and will work with you to design the perfect musical accompaniment to your special day. Please contact Sarah to discuss the options available.
