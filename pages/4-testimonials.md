> Sarah made our wedding ceremony so special. Her voice is absolutely beautiful and sang the hymns beautifully; all our guests commented on her amazing voice.  We loved having Sarah sing with our harpist accompanying and made the signing of the register such a perfect moment . She is incredibly talented, open to suggestions that you may have and is a pleasure to have at your wedding.  Thank you so much Sarah.
